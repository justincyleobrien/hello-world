# hello-world
my first repository

Hello!

I am new to coding and this is my first Github repository. I have been learning some python on and off over the last couple of months and plan on kicking my learning into high gear with the new year. I havent decided exactly what I want to do with coding yet, but python is the first language I am learning.
